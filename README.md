Paper ID-9396: Design and Analysis of an Improved Gain Single Inductor Dual Switch DC-DC Converter with Reduced Duty Ratio and Minimal Voltage Stress

This paper presents an IGSIDSC for grid integration of solar and fuel cells, achieving high voltage gain at a reduced duty ratio (<50%). The design minimizes losses, reduces voltage stress, and allows cost-effective component selection. A common ground configuration mitigates dv/dt issues. Steady-state analysis includes parasitic resistances. A 200 W prototype validates its steady-state and dynamic performance.
